1. Code Structure & Modularity

Split the codebase into clear modules: `neo4j_loader.py`, `pinecone_uploader.py`, `embeddings.py`, and `hybrid_chat.py`.

This modular approach improves maintainability, debugging, and scalability.

2. Robust Error Handling

Added try–except blocks for all external API calls (Neo4j, Pinecone, OpenAI).

Implemented fallback messages for connection or API failures.

3. Efficient Data Loading

Batched Pinecone upserts (32 at a time) to reduce latency.

Used index existence checks before recreating, ensuring idempotent uploads.

4. Enhanced Logging & Clarity

Added detailed logs for each step: embedding creation, Neo4j node creation, and hybrid retrieval pipeline.

This helps in debugging and monitoring real-time system performance.

5. Improved Prompt Engineering

Crafted structured prompts to GPT, including retrieved documents and graph context.

This ensures more coherent and context-rich responses.

6. Streamlit UI Integration

Developed a simple UI (`app.py`) to test hybrid queries visually.

This improves user interaction and debugging efficiency.

7. Thought Process & Reasoning

The goal was to create a system that combines structured (graph) and unstructured (semantic) knowledge.
Neo4j provides factual, relationship-based context, while Pinecone + GPT handle semantic flexibility.
This design mimics how humans recall — combining facts + associations.
